# Quest for Knowledge

## Goal

Though we learn much stuff at university that gives information on various theoretical aspects, 
often the things you need at actually working as programmer differs from what you learn at university. 

This project should cover these topics in a playful manner by asking some questions 
that should drive the reader deeper in topics that are really important for a professional programmer (f.e. testing, CI and so on)

Some Chapters also aim to give an easy introduction to programming languages (Easy skip, if one had that already at university). 

## Chapter 1: Introduction to important tools
Very basic, many might want to skip that. 
+ Git
+ Virtualization
+ Linux

## Chapter 2: Introduction to C
